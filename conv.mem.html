The result of the conversion refers to the same member as the pointer to
member before the conversion took place, but it refers to the base class
member as if it were a member of the derived class. The result refers to
the member in <span class='texttt'>D</span>'s instance of <span class='texttt'>B</span>. Since the result has
type “pointer to member of <span class='texttt'>D</span> of type <span class='textit'>cv</span> <span class='texttt'>T</span>”,
indirection through it with a <span class='texttt'>D</span> object is valid. The result is the same
as if indirecting through the pointer to member of <span class='texttt'>B</span> with the
<span class='texttt'>B</span> subobject of <span class='texttt'>D</span>. The null member pointer value is
converted to the null member pointer value of the destination
