Some constraints are:
</p><ul ><li ><p >The controlled input sequence can be not readable.
</p></li><li ><p >The controlled output sequence can be not writable.
</p></li><li ><p >The controlled sequences can be associated with the contents of other
representations for character sequences, such as external files.
</p></li><li ><p >The controlled sequences can support operations
<i>directly</i>
to or from associated sequences.
</p></li><li ><p >The controlled sequences can impose limitations on how the program can
read characters from a sequence,
write characters to a sequence,
put characters back into an input sequence, or
alter the stream position.
</p></li></ul></div><div class='para' id='2'><div class='marginalizedparent'><a class='marginalized' href='#2'>2</a></div><p >Each sequence is characterized by three pointers which, if non-null,
all point into the same
<span class='texttt'>charT</span>
array object.
The array object represents, at any moment,
a (sub)sequence of characters from the sequence.
Operations performed on a sequence alter the values stored in these pointers,
perform reads and writes directly to or from associated sequences, and
alter “the stream position” and conversion state as needed to
maintain this subsequence relationship.
The three pointers are:
</p><ul ><li ><p >the
<i>beginning pointer</i>,
or lowest element address in the array
(called <span class='texttt'>xbeg</span> here);
</p></li><li ><p >the
<i>next pointer</i>,
or next element address that is a current
candidate for reading or writing (called <span class='texttt'>xnext</span> here);
</p></li><li ><p >the
<i>end pointer</i>,
or first element address beyond the end of
the array (called <span class='texttt'>xend</span> here).

into the same

<span class='texttt'>xend</span> shall also be null.

<span class='texttt'>*xnext</span>

next element to write

<span class='texttt'>xbeg &lt; xnext</span> for an input sequence,

<span class='texttt'>xnext[-1]</span>
