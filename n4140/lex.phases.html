The precedence among the syntax rules of translation is specified by the
following phases.<a class='footnotenum' href='#footnote-11'>11</a></p><ol class='enumerate'><li id='1.1'><p ><span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='source_file'></a></span><span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='character,source_file'></a></span><span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='character_set,basic_source'></a></span></p><p >Physical source file characters are mapped, in an
<span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='mapping_physical_source_file_characters_to_basic_source_character_set'></a></span>implementation-defined manner,
to the basic source character set (introducing new-line characters for end-of-line
indicators) if necessary.
The set of physical source file characters accepted is <span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='physical_source_file_characters'></a></span>implementation-defined.
<span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='trigraph_sequence'></a></span>Trigraph sequences (<a href='lex.trigraph'>[lex.trigraph]</a>) are

source file character not in the basic source character
set (<a href='lex.charset'>[lex.charset]</a>) is replaced by the
<span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='universal_character_name'></a></span>universal-character-name that
designates that character. (An implementation may use any internal
encoding, so long as an actual extended character encountered in the
source file, and the same extended character expressed in the source
file as a universal-character-name (i.e., using the <span class='texttt'>\uXXXX</span> notation), are handled equivalently
except where this replacement is reverted in a raw string literal.)</p><p ><span class='indexparent'><a class='index' id='line_splicing'></a></span></p></li><li id='1.2'><p >Each instance of a backslash character (\)
immediately followed by a new-line character is deleted, splicing
physical source lines to form logical source lines. Only the last
backslash on any physical source line shall be eligible for being part
of such a splice.
Except for splices reverted in a raw string literal, if a splice results in
a character sequence that matches the
syntax of a universal-character-name, the behavior is
undefined. A source file that is not empty and that does not end in a new-line
character, or that ends in a new-line character immediately preceded by a
backslash character before any such splicing takes place,
shall be processed as if an additional new-line character were appended
to the file.</p></li><li id='1.3'><p >The source file is decomposed into preprocessing

preprocessing token or in a partial comment.<a class='footnotenum' href='#footnote-12'>12</a>
Each comment is replaced by one space character. New-line characters are
retained. Whether each nonempty sequence of white-space characters other
than new-line is retained or replaced by one space character is
unspecified. The process of dividing a source file's
characters into preprocessing tokens is context-dependent.

If a character sequence that matches the syntax of a
universal-character-name is produced by token
concatenation (<a href='cpp.concat'>[cpp.concat]</a>), the behavior is undefined. A
<span class='texttt'>#include</span> preprocessing directive causes the named header or
source file to be processed from phase 1 through phase 4, recursively.
